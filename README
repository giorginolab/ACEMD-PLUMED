METADYNAMICS ON ALANINE DIPEPTIDE: PHI-PSI FREE ENERGY DEMO
===========================================================

This is a test case reproducing the phi-psi alanine dipeptide free
energy plot shown e.g. in references [1] and [2] via PLUMED 1.


Methods
-------

This demo uses ACEMD [3] and PLUMED 1 [2] to compute the phi-psi free
energy landscape of the alanine dipeptide via well-tempered
metadynamics [1]. The dipeptide is modelled in vacuo with the CHARMM
forcefield.  The total length of the run is 10 ns, simulated with a
timestep of 1 fs. There are 100,000 gaussians in total, deposited at a
rate of 1 every 100 fs.


Requirements
------------

This demo relies on PLUMED 1. The easiest way to obtain it is to
install the plumed1 package in Acellera's conda channel, which
includes the required ACEMD-compatible version of PLUMED packaged as a
shared library. If you installed acemd via Conda, you may already have
it in your system.


Set-up
------

We assume that you have ACEMD and PLUMED installed and tested. The
file *libplumed1plugin.so* should be linked in your current directory,
or be copied in one of the directories explained by `acemd --command
pluginload'.  For example, issue this:

    ln -s `dirname \`which conda\``/../lib/libplumed1plugin.so .
    
Note that the simulation will start even if the plugin is not found!


Run the simulation
------------------

To launch the simulation, type

	shell>  acemd acemd_input

This will take several hours. 



Compute and plot the free-energy surface
----------------------------------------

Use the "sum_hills" program, part of the PLUMED distribution, to
compute the 2D free energy surface.

	shell>	sum_hills -ndim 2 -ndw 1 2 -pi 1 -pi 2 


The landscape can be plotted with gnuplot or other programs.

	shell>	gnuplot
	gnuplot>  plot "fes.dat" with image



Animations
----------

You can try "sum_hills" then "gnuplot" even while the simulation is
running. This allows you to see metadynamics in action, gradually
filling the free energy surface. 

The "reference/animate_fes_100k.avi" file shows an animation of what's
happening. There are 1000 animation frames taken at 10 ps
intervals. Between each frame and the next, 100 gaussians are
deposited. Observe how (at the beginning) the free energy basins are
alternatively filled.

Note that you will need a recent movie player application to display
the animation, which is encoded in the h264 format. VLC and mplayer
will do.


Remarks
-------

Note that the simulation will start even if the plugin is not found!

Consider that Plumed computes forces on the CPU, thus it will likely
slow down ACEMD. Also, keep into account that, by default (i.e., not
using GRID), the computation burden increases with each accumulated
hill.

Restarts are supported in PLUMED1, but they require special care to be
in sync with ACEMD's checkpoints.
